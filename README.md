# m-more

PKGBUILDs are moved to [m-more2](https://github.com/manuel-192/m-more2).
Release assets are also moved to [m-more2], so you **must** make a change in file /etc/pacman.conf:
repo name [m-more] must be changed to [m-more2].

Old release assets that still exist here are already partially outdated, and will be removed in the near future.
